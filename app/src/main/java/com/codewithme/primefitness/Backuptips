find transport id using adb devices -l

adb -t Transport_ID backup -f [backup_name].adb -noapk com.example.primefitness

this is the backup without apk (for apk do -apk), you can backup apk as well but when restoring apk is not installed automatically,
but take whole backup with apk, then you have the apk as well.

to restore, firstly the apk should be installed, then
adb -t Transport_ID restore [backup_name].adb

in wsl, to extract .adb
dd if=[backup_name].adb bs=24 skip=1 | zlib-flate -uncompress | tar xf -
stored in apps folder
